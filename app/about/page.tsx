        About HnCC HnCC or Hackathon and Coding Club is the official club of BIT
        Sindri that has the motto to instill a coding culture, collaborate, and
        arrange events relevant to Open Source, Graphics and Game Development,
        Web Development, App Development, and many other topics. Many students
        at the institute are doing well, but they can do even more if they get
        proper guidance. These students invariably maintain contact with a
        select lot of elite, wise seniors who act as mentors or friends. The
        purpose of HnCC is to provide an official platform for these efforts to
        encourage them by officially endorsing them and helping them surmount
        the hostel boundaries for a healthier and fruitful network.
